It is based on dynamic programming and makes use of the fact that the number of positive subinstances is typically substantially smaller than the number of all subinstances. Algorithms producing only such subinstances are called positive-instance driven (PID). The parameter treedepth has a similar story. It was popularized through the graph sparsity project and is theoretically well understood—but the first practical algorithm was discovered only recently by Trimble (IPEC 2020) and is based on the same paradigm. We give an alternative and unifying view on such algorithms from the perspective of the corresponding configuration graphs in certain two-player games. This results in a single algorithm that can compute a wide range of important graph parameters such as treewidth, pathwidth, and treedepth. We complement this algorithm with a novel randomized data structure that accelerates the enumeration of subproblems in positive-instance driven algorithms.","tags":[],"title":"Recent Advances in Positive-Instance Driven Graph Searching","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sebastian Berndt","Jan Wichelmann","Claudius Pott","Tim-Henrik Traving","Thomas Eisenbarth"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1633206817,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1633206817,"objectID":"c5106557ad6cbf09321511ee16aed23e","permalink":"/publication/asiaccs2022/","publishdate":"2021-10-02T22:33:37+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/asiaccs2022/","section":"publication","summary":"The security of digital communication relies on few cryptographic protocols that are used to protect internet traffic, from web sessions to instant messaging.

Base64 decoding is used when loading keys stored in PEM format. We show that these functions by themselves leak sufficient information even if libraries are executed in trusted execution environments.

This class of signature schemes includes Picnic, an alternate candidate in the third round of the NIST post-quantum standardization project. The only previously known approach to masking MPC-in-the-head signatures suffers from interoperability issues and increased signature sizes. Further, we present a new attack to demonstrate that known countermeasures are not sufficient when the MPC protocol uses a preprocessing phase, as in Picnic3.\n\nWe overcome these challenges by showing how to mask the underlying zero-knowledge proof system due to Katz–Kolesnikov–Wang (CCS 2018) for any masking order, and by formally proving that our approach meets the standard security notions of non-interference for masking countermeasures. As a case study, we apply our masking technique to Picnic. We then implement different masked versions of Picnic signing providing first order protection for the ARM Cortex M4 platform, and quantify the overhead of these different masking approaches. We carefully analyze the side-channel risk of hashing operations, and give optimizations that reduce the CPU cost of protecting hashing in Picnic by a factor of five.

While during their advent, most messenger apps focused on features rather than security, this has changed in the recent years: Since then, many have adapted end-to-end encryption as a standard feature. One of the most popular solutions is the Signal messenger, which aims to guarantee forward secrecy (i.e. security of previous communications in case of leakage of long-term secrets) and future secrecy (i.e. security of future communications in case of leakage of short-term secrets). If every user uses exactly one device, it is known that Signal achieves forward secrecy and even post-compromise security (i.e. security of future communications in case of leakage of long-term secrets). But the Signal protocol also allows for the use of multiple devices via the Sesame protocol. This multi-device setting is typically ignored in the security analysis of Signal.\n\nIn this work, we discuss the security of the Signal messenger in this multi-device setting. We show that the current implementation of the device registration allows an attacker to register an own, malicious device, which gives them unrestricted access to all future communication of their victim, and even allows full impersonation. This directly shows that the current Signal implementation does not guarantee post-compromise security. We discuss several countermeasures, both simple ones aiming to increase detectability of our attack, as well as a broader approach that seeks to solve the root issue, namely the weak device registration flow.\n ","tags":[],"title":"Help, my Signal has bad Device!

The distance between an optimal solution $x$ w.r.t.~$b$ and an optimal solution $x'$ w.r.t.~$b'$ (called the \\emph{sensitivity}) is similarly bounded, i.e., by $\\lVert b-b' \\rVert_{1}\\cdot \\Delta^{\\Theta(d)}$ as shown by Cook et al.~(Math. Program., 1986). Even after more than thirty years, these bounds are essentially the best known bounds for these measures. While some lower bounds are known for these measures, they either only work for very small values of $\\Delta$ or require negative entries in the constraint matrix. Hence, these lower bounds often do not correspond to instances from algorithmic problems. In this work, we present for each $\\Delta \u003e 0$ and each $d \u003e 0$ IPs of the above type with non-negative constraint matrices, such that their proximitiy and sensitivity is at least $\\Delta^{\\Theta(d)}$. Furthermore, these instances are closely related to instances of the Bin Packing problem as they form a subset of columns of the \\emph{configuration IP}. We thereby show that the results of Cook et al.~are indeed tight, even for instances arising naturally from problems in combinatorial optimization.

With widespread use come the spectres of implementation issues and implementation attacks. Side-channel attacks are a serious threat to the security of implementations of secure cryptographic protocols due to unintended leakage of sensitive information. We show that implementations of protocols constructed by the MPC-in-the-head paradigm are vulnerable to such attacks. As a case study, we choose the ZKBoo-protocol of Giacomelli, Madsen, and Orlandi (USENIX 2016) and show that even a single leaked value is sufficient to break the security of the protocol. To show that this attack is not just a theoretical vulnerability, we apply differential power analysis to show the vulnerabilities of the device.\n\nIn order to remedy this situation, we extend and generalize the ZKBoo-protocol by making use of the notion of strong non-interference of Barthe et al. (CCS 2016). To apply this notion to ZKBoo, we construct novel versions of strongly non-interfering gadgets that balance the randomness across the different branches evenly. Finally, we show that each circuit can be decomposed into branches using only these balanced strongly non-interfering gadgets. This allows us to construct a version of ZKBoo, called $(n+1)$-ZKBoo secure against side-channel attacks with very limited overhead in both signature-size and running time. Furthermore, $(n+1)$-ZKBoo is scalable to the desired security against adversarial probes. We experimentally confirm that the attacks successful against ZKBoo no longer work on $(n+1)$-ZKBoo.\n ","tags":[],"title":"SNI-in-the-head: Protecting MPC-in-the-head Protocols against Side-channel Analysis (CCS 2020)","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1596001769,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1596001769,"objectID":"aedd116243b4da165538fa29b906f5ef","permalink":"/post/ccs2020/","publishdate":"2020-07-29T07:49:29+02:00","relpermalink":"/post/ccs2020/","section":"post","summary":"Our paper *SNI-in-the-head: Protecting MPC-in-the-head Protocols against Side-channel Analysis* was accepted at CCS 2020.","tags":null,"title":"CCS 2020","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1593409769,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1593409769,"objectID":"8850da74cd5f92c12df53a6918df678c","permalink":"/post/mfcs2020/","publishdate":"2020-06-29T07:49:29+02:00","relpermalink":"/post/mfcs2020/","section":"post","summary":"Our paper *Solving Packing Problems with Few Small Items Using Rainbow Matchings* was accepted at MFCS 2020.","tags":null,"title":"MFCS 2020","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1592804969,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1592804969,"objectID":"fa14d36415b66930fe80283e71f7b9bf","permalink":"/post/pace2020/","publishdate":"2020-06-22T07:49:29+02:00","relpermalink":"/post/pace2020/","section":"post","summary":"We participated in the [PACE 2020 treedepth challenge](https://pacechallenge.org/2020/) and got place 4 out of 15 in the [exact track](https://github.com/maxbannach/PID-Star) and place 5 out of 10 in the [heuristic track](https://github.com/maxbannach/Fluid).

At CCS'15, Ateniese, Magri, and\nVenturi extended this model to allow the attackers to work in a fully-adaptive\nand continuous fashion and proposed subversion attacks against digital signature\nschemes. Both papers also showed the impossibility of ASAs in cases where the\ncryptographic tools are deterministic. Also at CCS'15, Bellare, Jaeger, and Kane\nstrengthened the original model and proposed a universal ASA against\nsufficiently random encryption schemes. In this paper we analyze ASAs from the\nperspective of steganography - the well known concept of hiding the presence of\nsecret messages in legal communications. While a close connection between ASAs\nand steganography is known, this lacks a rigorous treatment. We consider the\ncommon computational model for secret-key steganography and prove that\nsuccessful ASAs correspond to secure stegosystems on certain channels and vice\nversa. This formal proof allows us to conclude that ASAs are stegosystems and to\n'rediscover' several results concerning ASAs known in the steganographic\nliterature.","tags":null,"title":"Algorithm Substitution Attacks from a Steganographic Perspective (CCS 2017)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Max Bannach","Sebastian Berndt","Thorsten Ehlers"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1498003200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1498003200,"objectID":"d2a1cec95582fbd0280a1cafe4afb909","permalink":"/publication/sea2017/","publishdate":"2017-06-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sea2017/","section":"publication","summary":"While the theoretical aspects concerning the computation of tree\nwidth - one of the most important graph parameters - are well understood, it is\nnot clear how it can be computed practically.

The goal is, of course, to minimize\nboth the number of bins used as well as the amount of repacking. A recently introduced way of\nmeasuring the repacking costs at each timestep is the migration factor, defined as the total size\nof repacked items divided by the size of an arriving or departing item. Concerning the trade-off\nbetween number of bins and migration factor, if we wish to achieve an asymptotic competitive\nratio of $1+\\epsilon$ for the number of bins, a relatively simple argument proves a lower bound of $\\Omega(1/\\epsilon)$\non the migration factor.

The running time of our algorithm is polynomial in the number of\nitems $n$ and in $1/\\epsilon$ . The previous best trade-off was for an asymptotic competitive ratio of $5/4$ for\nthe bins (rather than $1+\\epsilon$) and needed an amortized number of $O(\\log n)$ repackings (while in\nour scheme the number of repackings is independent of $n$ and non-amortized).","tags":null,"title":"Fully Dynamic Bin Packing Revisited (APPROX-RANDOM 2015)","type":"publication"}]
