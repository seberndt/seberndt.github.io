Our system is unconditionally secure, i.e. our\nproof does not rely on any unproven complexity-theoretic assumption, like e.g.\nthe existence of one-way functions. This disproves the claim that the existence\nof one-way functions and access to a communication channel oracle are both\nnecessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of secure steganography,\nin the sense that secure and reliable steganography exists independently of the\nexistence of one-way functions.

The goal is, of course, to minimize\nboth the number of bins used as well as the amount of repacking. A recently introduced way of\nmeasuring the repacking costs at each timestep is the migration factor, defined as the total size\nof repacked items divided by the size of an arriving or departing item. Concerning the trade-off\nbetween number of bins and migration factor, if we wish to achieve an asymptotic competitive\nratio of $1+\\epsilon$ for the number of bins, a relatively simple argument proves a lower bound of $\\Omega(1/\\epsilon)$\non the migration factor. We establish a fairly close upper bound of $O(1/\\epsilon^4 \\log(1/\\epsilon))$\nusing a new\ndynamic rounding technique and new ideas to handle small items in a dynamic setting such that\nno amortization is needed. The running time of our algorithm is polynomial in the number of\nitems $n$ and in $1/\\epsilon$ . The previous best trade-off was for an asymptotic competitive ratio of $5/4$ for\nthe bins (rather than $1+\\epsilon$) and needed an amortized number of $O(\\log n)$ repackings (while in\nour scheme the number of repackings is independent of $n$ and non-amortized).","tags":null,"title":"Fully Dynamic Bin Packing Revisited (APPROX-RANDOM 2015)","type":"publication"}]
