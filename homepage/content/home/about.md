# Biography

Sebastian Berndt is a Ph.D. student at the Institute of Theoretical
Computer Science at the University of LÃ¼beck. His research interest
include the foundations of cryptography and steganography and
algorithmic approaches to intractable (i.e. $\mathcal{NP}$-hard)
problems such as approximation algorithms or
fixed-parameter-tractability.
