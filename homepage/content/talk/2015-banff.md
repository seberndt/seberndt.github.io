title = "Fully Dynamic Bin Packing Revisited"

abstract = '''We consider the fully dynamic bin packing problem, where
items arrive and depart in an online fashion and repacking of previously
packed items is allowed. The goal is to minimize both the number of bins
used as well as the amount of repacking. We measure the repacking by the
migration factor, de ned as the total size of repacked items divided by
the size of an arriving or departing item. If one wishes to achieve an
asymptotic competitive ration of $1+\epsilon$ for the number of bins, a
relatively simple argument proves a lower bound of
$\mathcal{O}(1/\epsilon)$ for the migration factor. We establish a nearly
matching upper bound of $\mathcal{O}((1/\epsilon)^4\cdot
\log(1/\epsilon))$ using a new dynamic rounding technique and new ideas
to handle small items in a dynamic setting such that no amortization is
needed. The running time of our algorithm is polynomial in the number of
items $n$ and in $1/\epsilon$ The previous best trade-off was for an asymptotic
competitive ratio of $5/4$ for the bins (rather than $1+\epsilon$) and needed an
amortized number of $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$ repackings (while in our scheme the number
of repackings is independent of $n$ and non-amortized). Joint work with
Klaus Jansen and Kim-Manuel Klein.'''
