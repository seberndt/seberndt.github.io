title = "On the Relation between Steganography and Cryptography"

abstract = '''We consider steganography - a concept of hiding the
presence of secret messages in legal communications - in the
computational setting and its relation to cryptography. While
steganography is widely used in numerous systems nowadays and a large
body of practical work on it exists, the understanding of its
theoretical foundation is still lacking.

In their influential work from 2002, Hopper, Langford and von Ahn stated
that (non-polynomial) steganography and cryptography are equivalent to
each other. In this talk, we present a non-polynomial secure stegosystem
that does not rely on any unproven assumptions. This disproves the above
equivalence. Furthermore, we show that even polynomial-time
steganography and cryptography are not equivalent by giving (a) a
channel for which secure steganography exists if and only if one-way
functions exist and (b) another channel such that secure steganography
implies that no one-way functions exist. We therefore show that
security-preserving reductions between cryptography and steganography
need to be treated very carefully and that - contrary to popular belief
- steganography is not equivalent to cryptography.'''
