  title: Biography
  summary: |
    Sebastian Berndt is a professor for applied mathematics and IT security at the <a href="https://www.th-luebeck.de/">Technische Hochschule Lübeck</a>. His research interests revolve around intractable problems. On the one hand, he applies these problems to cryptography and steganography to enable secure communication. On the other hand, he tries to solve them with approaches such as approximation algorithms or fixed-parameter-tractability.
