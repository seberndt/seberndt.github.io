summary: "Two new preprints are available. 
In [the first paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.10847), we investigate the vertices of the integer hull, the integer analogues of basic feasible solutions. We either match or improve the best known upper bounds on their number via surprisingly simple probabilistic methods.
In [the second paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/544), we show how to provably protect MPC-in-the-head protocols against sidechannel attacks. To illustrate this approach, we secured the Picnic signature scheme.
