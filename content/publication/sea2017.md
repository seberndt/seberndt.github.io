abstract = """While the theoretical aspects concerning the computation of tree
width - one of the most important graph parameters - are well understood, it is
not clear how it can be computed practically. We present the open source Java
library Jdrasil that implements several different state of the art algorithms
for this task. By experimentally comparing these algorithms, we show that the
default choices made in Jdrasil lead to an competitive implementation (it took
the third place in the first PACE challenge) while also being easy to use and
easy to extend. """
