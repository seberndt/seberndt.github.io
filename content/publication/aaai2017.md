abstract = """ Residuality plays an essential role for learning finite automata.
While residual deterministic and non-deterministic automata have been understood
quite well, fundamental questions concerning alternating automata (AFA) remain
open. Recently, Angluin, Eisenstat, and Fisman (2015) have initiated a
systematic study of residual AFAs and proposed an algorithm called AL* – an
extension of the popular L* algorithm – to learn AFAs. Based on computer
experiments they have conjectured that AL* produces residual AFAs, but have not
been able to give a proof. In this paper we disprove this conjecture by
constructing a counterexample. As our main positive result we design an
efficient learning algorithm, named AL** and give a proof that it outputs
residual AFAs only. In addition, we investigate the succinctness of these
different FA types in more detail."""
