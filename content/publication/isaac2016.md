# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = """This paper considers steganography - the concept of hiding the
presence of secret messages in legal communications - in the computational
setting and its relation to cryptography. Very recently the first
(non-polynomial time) steganographic protocol has been shown which, for any
communication channel, is provably secure, reliable, and has nearly optimal
bandwidth. The security is unconditional, i.e. it does not rely on any unproven
complexity-theoretic assumption. This disproves the claim that the existence of
one-way functions and access to a communication channel oracle are both
necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of secure steganography in
the sense that secure and reliable steganography exists independently of the
existence of one-way functions. In this paper, we prove that this equivalence
also does not hold in the more realistic setting, where the stegosystem is
polynomial time bounded. We prove this by constructing (a) a channel for which
secure steganography exists if and only if one-way functions exist and (b)
another channel such that secure steganography implies that no one-way functions
exist. We therefore show that security-preserving reductions between
cryptography and steganography need to be treated very carefully."""
