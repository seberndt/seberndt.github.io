abstract = """We present the first complexity-theoretic secure steganographic
protocol which, for any communication channel, is provably secure, reliable, and
has nearly optimal bandwidth. Our system is unconditionally secure, i.e. our
proof does not rely on any unproven complexity-theoretic assumption, like e.g.
the existence of one-way functions. This disproves the claim that the existence
of one-way functions and access to a communication channel oracle are both
necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of secure steganography,
in the sense that secure and reliable steganography exists independently of the
existence of one-way functions. """
