Integer programs (IPs) are one of the fundamental tools used
to solve combinatorial problems in theory and practice. Understanding
the structure of solutions of IPs is thus helpful to argue about the exis-
tence of solutions with a certain simple structure, leading to significant
algorithmic improvements. Typical examples for such structural proper-
ties are solutions that use a specific type of variable very often or solu-
tions that only contain few non-zero variables. The last decade has shown
the usefulness of this method. In this paper we summarize recent progress
for structural properties and their algorithmic implications in the area of
approximation algorithms and fixed parameter tractability. Concretely,
we show how these structural properties lead to optimal approximation
algorithms for the classical Makespan Scheduling scheduling problem
and to exact polynomial-time algorithm for the Bin Packing problem
with a constant number of different item sizes.
