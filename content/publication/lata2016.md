In order to transmit secret information, such that this transmission
cannot be detected, steganography needs a channel, a set of
strings with some distribution that occur in an ordinary communication.
The elements of such a language or concept are called coverdocuments.
The question how to design secure stegosystems for natural classes of
languages is investigated for pattern languages. We present a randomized
modification scheme for strings of a pattern language that can reliably
encode arbitrary messages and is almost undetectable."""
