abstract = """We consider the fully dynamic bin packing problem, where items arrive and depart in an online
fashion and repacking of previously packed items is allowed. The goal is, of course, to minimize
both the number of bins used as well as the amount of repacking. A recently introduced way of
measuring the repacking costs at each timestep is the migration factor, defined as the total size
of repacked items divided by the size of an arriving or departing item. Concerning the trade-off
between number of bins and migration factor, if we wish to achieve an asymptotic competitive
ratio of $1+\\epsilon$ for the number of bins, a relatively simple argument proves a lower bound of $\\Omega(1/\\epsilon)$
on the migration factor. We establish a fairly close upper bound of $O(1/\\epsilon^4 \\log(1/\\epsilon))$
using a new
dynamic rounding technique and new ideas to handle small items in a dynamic setting such that
no amortization is needed. The running time of our algorithm is polynomial in the number of
items $n$ and in $1/\\epsilon$ . The previous best trade-off was for an asymptotic competitive ratio of $5/4$ for
the bins (rather than $1+\\epsilon$) and needed an amortized number of $O(\\log n)$ repackings (while in
our scheme the number of repackings is independent of $n$ and non-amortized)."""
